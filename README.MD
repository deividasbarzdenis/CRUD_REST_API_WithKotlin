- Built Restful APIs for an employee information application. A user can create, retrieve, update and delete an employee using this application. An employee has an id, username, first name, last name, email id, and date of birth. Moreover, the username of an employee must be unique.

- Weâ€™ll use an embedded H2 database as our data source along with JPA and Hibernate to access the data from the database.
